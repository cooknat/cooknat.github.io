short-description: BlocJams - JavaScript and jQuery music player

---


Summary
------------
BlocJams is a simple browser based music player, allowing a user to select and play tracks from a collection of albums.

Explanation
------------
An introduction to the building blocks of web development, BlocJams uses CSS, HTML, JavaScript and jQuery, along with custom music library Buzz, to create a site which allows users to view a collection of albums before playing and controlling the music through a player overlaid on the album page.

The problem
------------
The main complexities in this project were around controlling the playback of the music, while ensuring the user is always presented a view which reflects the available options - for example only showing a play button when a song is highlighted.
