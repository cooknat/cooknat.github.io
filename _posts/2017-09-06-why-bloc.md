title: My Very Long Road to Becoming a Developer, or Why I Have Chosen to do Bloc

---
DRAFT
<!--
I really don't want to do this, but Angular is currently scrambling my brain, so!

Imagine a cheesy Hollywood rom com: a pair of gawky childhood friends spend their teenage years going through a series of will-they/won't-they moments, before finally seeing the light and falling for each other after various failed relationships, and you have a pretty good metaphor for my relationship with coding.

I've been enamoured with the idea since the age of seven, when the birthday gift of this: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron) and a subscription to this: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_User) got me interested, but despite several wet Sunday afternoons typing out the free programs included in the magazine, I unfortunately never developed my own capabilities beyond the basics.

After a masters' degree in Computer Science in my early twenties, and several jobs where I've been able to dabble but never to code all day, I made the decision that it was now or never.

A boot camp seemed like the perfect way to build on my existing knowledge, to modernise my skill set, to make the move to web focused technologies and toe build a portfolio. This way of learning seems to be becoming more and more popular and in London alone there is a wide range of courses on offer. Some of the classroom based ones looked very appealing but often seem to have a strong focus on the social aspect and spending evenings bonding. This sounds like a lot of fun, but someone has to put my kids to bed so unfortuntely that approach wasn't for me.

I ultimately chose Bloc as it provides a well rounded curriculum and the opportunity to work under your own steam, and the most valuable resource - an expert mentor who you can contact for help when you've been thinking yourself into a tangle for hours and Stack Exchange has failed you. Its so nice to know that you can contact someone and just say 'But whyyy.....', and get some help in working out what's wrong (Clue: its some missing parentheses. Its ALWAYS some missing parentheses :) )

When I first had formal lessons in coding, I learnt C++. I also taught myself HTML back at the turn of the millennium, so aspects of this first third of the curriculum have come quite easily - I could happily do codewars problems all day, and no problems with some basic markup. This has however thrown into sharp relief all the parts that are brand new. CSS is a mystery that I'm slowly uncovering. Angular is a terrible tease - one minute I think I understand, the next I realise I haven't a clue.

I intend to devote my next posts to the very basics of these 'brand-new' things, in the hope that writing them down will aid my understanding.
