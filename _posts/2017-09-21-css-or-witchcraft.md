Yes. Yes it is.

My advice. Stop reading all those useful books and blogs about the different ways you can achieve a 'simple' layout (simple! css! in the same sentence! ha!), instead buy yourself some chalk, draw a protective circle round yourself and summon down the demon SeeEssEss. Offer him a cup of peppermint tea (or whatever other hot beverage you have to hand - I hear he likes Horlicks) and show him your wireframes. He'll sort it out for you.

IF ONLY IT WERE THAT EASY.
